Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Breast-Cancer.csv dataset

Objective:The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing population data from 1970 to 2022 for countries around the world. The aim is to uncover insights into population trends, distributions, correlations, and outliers through visualizations.

 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

1. *Load and Inspect the Data*
   - *Load the dataset* into a pandas DataFrame.
   - *Inspect the structure* of the dataset (e.g., df.info() and df.describe()).
   - Check the *first few rows* of the dataset to get an initial look (e.g., df.head()).

2. *Check for Missing Values and Data Types*
   - Identify *missing values* in each column (e.g., df.isnull().sum()).
   - *Handle missing values* as necessary (e.g., dropping rows or imputing values).
   - Ensure the *data types* are correct (convert if necessary).

3. *Univariate Analysis*
   - *Explore the distributions* of individual variables.
   - Use *histograms* or *box plots* to identify the spread and skewness of each numerical feature.
   - Plot *categorical features* using bar plots.

4. *Outlier Detection*
   - Use *box plots* to identify potential outliers in numerical features.
   - *Handle outliers* based on their influence on the data and analysis.

5. *Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis*
   - Use *scatter plots* to explore relationships between pairs of variables, especially with the target variable.
   - Plot *correlation heatmaps* to identify multicollinearity between numerical features.

6. *Summary of Findings*
   - Document any insights gathered, such as *distribution patterns, **correlations, and **outliers*.
   - Highlight *any data cleaning or transformations* needed for the next task.
     
    TASK 2 PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

1. *Data Preprocessing*
   - *Separate the target variable* (dependent variable) from the features (independent variables).
   - *Split the dataset* into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) using train_test_split.

2. *Train the Model*
   - Initialize and *fit a linear regression model* on the training data.
   - Use *feature scaling* if required for better model performance (e.g., StandardScaler).

3. *Make Predictions on the Test Set*
   - Use the trained model to *predict target values* on the test set.

4. *Evaluate Model Performance*
   - Calculate *Mean Squared Error (MSE)* to assess average error in predictions.
   - Calculate *R-squared (R²)* to evaluate the percentage of variance explained by the model.
   - Document the evaluation metrics to understand the model’s accuracy.

5. *Visualize Results*
   - Plot the *regression line* against the training data to show the model’s fit.
   - Create an *Actual vs. Predicted* scatter plot to assess prediction accuracy on the test set.

6. *Summarize Findings*
   - Document the model’s performance and provide insights into how well the model generalizes.
   - *Reflect on potential improvements* (e.g., feature engineering or trying a different model).
